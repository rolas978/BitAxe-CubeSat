Universal 1U Cubesat  by Juliano85 on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4096437

Summary:
 Update - I have now included a remix of this Cubesat and expanded it to a 2U compatible size. Assembly is similar, please refer to 2U link https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4249498 As CubeSats become more popular, there are more 3d printable designs available now than ever. Still I found it challenging to integrate the most common CPU or MCU platforms available today - the Raspberry Pi or Arduino Uno. I set out to design my own that does not require print supports, looks good and can house different boards I regularly use.This 1U CubeSat is designed to be compatible with the 1U CubeSat standard developed by the California Polytechnic State University CubeSat Program.It is an educational non-spaceflight qualified model used for developing low cost CubeSat projects which can also be used for HAB (High Altitude Balloon) projects, Sounding Rocket projects or any other STEM related projects.This allows students, makers, space enthusiasts and CubeSat engineers to easily integrate common open-source platforms such as Raspberry Pi’s or Arduino Uno’s depending on application. It also has PC/104 compatibility.Other than the 3d prints themselves hardware required is;28 M3 x 10mm Philip Head Screws28 M3 NutsAt least 4 M3 Standoffs4 M2 Screws and Threaded inserts for the Raspberry Pi Cam V2 Module.Please refer to the instructions below on assembly, and selection of configuration.
